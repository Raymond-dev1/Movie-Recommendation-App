Being a backend engineer, i have always wanted to show my projects to users ,
Before this , i use raw dom-manipulation[vanillajs], though it worked, not concise but verbose , 
I built this project to layer my understanding of  frontend , react , state management , and modern styling with tailwind, 
And finally showcase my projects to users with modern technologies.
